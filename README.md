# Streamlining Cloud Platform Document Migration (CDMProj)

In this project, the Doxadvisors' migration team and I worked collaboratively to improve remote work capabilities, document security, and compliance. Due to confidentiality constraints, the original project is not published here. However, this repository small demo scripts that incorporate personal modifications and SQL knowledge I absorbed from participating the project. The goal for these scripts resembles a subsecton of the original project. These demos serve to showcase and illustrate the functionality of the project, providing a glimpse into the capabilities and magnitude of the original project.



Context / Aim
========================================
Doxadvisors has a unique suite of tools and assets enables clients to migrate seamlessly from different cloud-based document management platforms (DMS). With varying cloud platforms, the formats of the stored documents are also different and a new set of scripts and procedures needs to be tailored for the platforms. The goal of this project is to assist in the development of the protocal whilst also focusing on enhancements, including:
1. Improving migration efficiency (Reduce program runtime and manual processes)
2. Improving client experience (Implementing custom options and meeting special requests)
3. Minimizing error (Reduce manual processes, succinct comments and documentation, and straightforward code logic)

Project Significance
========================================
Towards the end of the project, the primary migration process achieved a milestone and has updated to a newer version.
Additionally, the documentation of the processes will serve as a basis for new recruits to learn the migration environment to minimize error when handling client data. 
Furthermore, through combining scripts (PowerShell and SQL) into larger executable scripts, there has been apparent reduction in workload on the team when completing projects.

Contents
========================================
1. Input file and output file for testing and reference purposes
2. Main Script: Contains the major procedures and executable procedure to pass input file and retrieve output file.
3. CreTab: Creates the tables required for Main Script to run
4. ProFu: Defines supporting procedures and functions used in Main Script
